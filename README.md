Welcome to my collection project. This full-stack project has been created using following technologies:

- Mongo database
- Mongoose object modeling

- Express framework
- Embedded JavaScript templating (ejs)
- Skeleton CSS framework
- JavaScript
- HTML
- Visual Studio Code
- Git version control
- Heroku cloud deployment

MY COLLECTION
This project is designed to demonstrate the ability to create a full stack application deployed to a cloud platform.  This simple design addresses all the elements required for an end-to-end, full-stack application. In addition to the above technologies, this application includes SoC (separation of concerns) through the use of a controller and applies the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle with the use of partials.

I hope you enjoy your experience while navigating my collection of Council Shoulder Patches from the state of Georgia!
