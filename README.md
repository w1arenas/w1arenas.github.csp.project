## The Project
Welcome to my collection project. The project showcases part of my collection of BSA Council Shoulder Patches and it has been designed to demonstrate the ability to create a full stack application deployed to a cloud platform.

## Technologies
 This full-stack project has been created using following technologies:

- Mongo database
- Mongoose object modeling
- RESTful architecture
- CRUD functionality
- Express framework
- Embedded JavaScript templating (ejs)
- Skeleton CSS framework
- JavaScript
- HTML
- Visual Studio Code
- Git version control
- Heroku cloud deployment

In addition to the above technologies, this application includes:

 - Responsive web design.
 - SoC (separation of concerns) through the use of a controller.
 - DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle through the use of partials.
